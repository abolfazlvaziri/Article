Advanced and sophisticated attacks now being deployed by anonymous individuals have significantly increased the importance of security in the web and hosting spaces. Given the plethora of security threats, choosing a secure and reliable hosting service is a top priority for any business. One of the popular and secure options in this field is the use of CloudLinux-Enabled hosting.

# What is CloudLinux?
CloudLinux is a commercial Linux-based operating system specifically designed for web hosting. Its primary goal is to enhance the security, stability, and performance of shared hosting servers through user isolation and resource management.

### 1. User Isolation with Lightweight Virtual Environment (LVE)
One of CloudLinux’s standout features is the use of **LVE** technology for isolating users. This technology allocates a dedicated virtual environment to each user, limiting CPU, RAM, and I/O resources. This isolation ensures that any malicious activity or excessive resource usage by one user does not impact other users.

### 2. Enhanced Account Security with CageFS
The **CageFS** is a virtual file system in CloudLinux that restricts user access to critical server files and information. This feature ensures that even if a user account is compromised, hackers can not access system files or other accounts. **CageFS** improves overall server security by hiding sensitive files and system configurations.

### 3. Resource Management and DDoS Attack Prevention
CloudLinux provides tools for managing and limiting users’ resource consumption, preventing **DDoS** attacks. These tools can identify and restrict excessive resource usage by a single user, ensuring that server performance and website services remain unaffected. This feature is particularly beneficial for high-traffic and sensitive websites.

### 4. Support for PHP Selector and Up-to-date Software
One of CloudLinux’s features is the **PHP Selector**, which allows users to choose and use their desired **PHP** version. This capability ensures that users can always use the latest and most secure **PHP** versions, receiving security updates regularly. Continuous software and plugin updates play a crucial role in preventing security issues. This feature is especially useful for WordPress site designers.

### 5. Advanced Monitoring and Reporting Tools
CloudLinux offers advanced monitoring tools that allow server administrators to continuously monitor server performance and security. These tools provide detailed and comprehensive reports, helping to identify and quickly resolve security issues. They can also detect suspicious activities and potential attacks, enabling prompt action.

### 6. MYSQL Governor Tool
The **MYSQL Governor** tool can maximize server performance and stability, as most of your hosting resource consumption on the server is from **MYSQL** or the database. With this tool, controlling account consumption is easily achievable.

Other tools like **HardenedPHP** and **SecureLinks**, in addition to improving performance, enhance server and account security. As you know, some old and even new PHP versions are no longer supported. The **HardenedPHP** tool allows you to use them safely. The **SecureLinks** feature protects the operating system kernel from SymLinks attacks, ensuring maximum security.

Unfortunately, many **Web Developers** and **WordPress Site designers,** aiming to reduce employer costs or increase their own profits, overlook important aspects such as website hosting and security. This negligence can lead to serious vulnerabilities, loss of sensitive information, and even website downtime. Therefore, understanding the importance of choosing secure hosting, particularly with technologies like **CloudLinux**, is essential for maintaining website security and stability.
