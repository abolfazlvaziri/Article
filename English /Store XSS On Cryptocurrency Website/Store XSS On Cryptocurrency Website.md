Sometimes vulnerability is in the simplest things that cannot be seen…
I haven’t been in the mood to work for a while and I just spend my time studying and doing a little work, of course, things like this are normal in our work world and we get like this every once in a while and next then we get better and go back to the previous routine.

One of these days, while I was checking my telegram messages, I saw that a channel talked about a Cryptocurrency Website that rewards those who discover vulnerabilities, I took a look at it and tried as a normal user, I encountered this when I registered:

As you can see, my username is displayed on the screen, after seeing this, I went to the registration section again and injected this code and created a new account:

And Next:

Store **XSS** Vulnerability discovered.
The injected code was executed in all sections because the user name was displayed in all sections of the program, and this increases the severity of the vulnerability.

At that moment, I wrote a full report and reported to the technical team, and they fixed the vulnerability after 24 hours, But after fixing the vulnerability, I did not receive any response from them and no reward was given for the vulnerability.

I trusted the post of a reliable Telegram channel and it caused me to repeat another experience that is very useful for beginners, as much as possible, **do not operate without the approval of the program and outside the Bugbunty platform.**
